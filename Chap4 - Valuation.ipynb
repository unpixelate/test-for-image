    "## Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Valuation is the process of estimating the worth of an asset, such as a company, stock, property, or intellectual property, in order to determine a fair price for the asset. This involves analyzing the asset's financial and market data, including revenue, earnings, and cash flow, to determine its future potential and calculate its value based on various financial models and methodologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "## History of valuation\n",
    "\n",
    "The history of valuation dates back thousands of years and has evolved over time. The earliest forms of valuation were based on bartering, where goods or services were exchanged for other goods or services. With the development of currency and commerce, the need for more structured methods of valuation arose.\n",
    "In ancient Greece and Rome, valuations were based on the cost of labor and materials required to produce an item. During the Middle Ages, the concept of fair market value was introduced, which was based on the idea of what a buyer would pay for an item in a free and open market.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the 19th century, the industrial revolution and the rise of the stock market created a need for more sophisticated valuation methods, leading to the development of financial analysis and the use of discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis. Today, there are many different valuation methods used in various industries, including real estate, financial securities, and intellectual property."

    "### Comparable company analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparable company analysis (also known as \"peer company analysis\" or \"comps\") is a financial valuation method that compares the financial metrics of a company with those of similar companies in order to estimate its value. It's often used in M&A and equity research. The financial metrics used in a comparable company analysis typically include revenue, EBITDA, EBIT, and enterprise value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparable Company Analysis (or Comps) is a valuation method used to estimate the value of a company by comparing it to similar companies that have already gone public or been acquired.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a simple mathematical example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have 3 comparable companies, A, B, and C, and their respective market capitalization (Market Cap) is $100 million, $120 million, and $150 million. To find the average market capitalization, we can add all 3 values and divide by 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Average\\ Market\\ Cap = \\frac{100 + 120 + 150}{3} = 120$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if we have another company, X, with similar financial and operational characteristics as the comparable companies, we can estimate its value by using the average market capitalization of the comparable companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Value\\ of\\ Company\\ X = Average\\ Market\\ Cap = 120$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example of application would be as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we want to value a software company X. We look at its financials and find that it has revenue of $100 million, an operating margin of 30%, and a growth rate of 20%.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then compare company X to other similar software companies, say companies A, B, and C. We find that these companies have the following financials:\n",
    "\n",
    "Company A: Revenue $90 million, operating margin of 25\\%, and a growth rate of 25\\%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Company B: Revenue $110 million, operating margin of 35\\%, and a growth rate of 15\\%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Company C: Revenue $80 million, operating margin of 20\\%, and a growth rate of 30\\%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using comparable company analysis, we can estimate the value of company X by comparing its financials to the financials of companies A, B, and C.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we can estimate the value of company X based on its revenue, operating margin, and growth rate as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Value of company X = (Revenue * Operating margin * Growth rate) / (Market average operating margin * Market average growth rate) \n",
    "\n",
    "Value of company X = ($100 million * 30% * 20%) / (27.5% * 22.5%) \n",
    "\n",
    "Value of company X = $280 million\n",
    "\n",
    "This is just an example, and the actual value of company X could be different based on various factors such as industry trends, competition, market conditions, etc. However, comparable company analysis provides a starting point for valuing a company based on market data."

    "### Discounted cashflow\n",
    "\n",
    "Discounted cash flow (DCF) is a financial method used to evaluate the value of an investment based on the present value of its future cash flows. This approach takes into account the time value of money, which means that money is worth more in the present than it is in the future due to factors such as inflation and the opportunity cost of not investing that money elsewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use DCF, an analyst must estimate the future cash flows that an investment is expected to generate and then \"discount\" them back to their present value using an appropriate discount rate. The resulting present value represents the estimated value of the investment today.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a simple example of how to use DCF:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that you are considering investing in a rental property. You expect to earn \\\\$10,000 per year in rental income over the next 10 years, and you expect to sell the property for $200,000 at the end of the 10-year period. Assuming that your required rate of return is 8%, you can use DCF to estimate the present value of the investment as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate the present value of each year's rental income using the following formula: Present Value = Cash Flow / (1 + Discount Rate)^Number of Years\n",
    "For example, the present value of the rental income in Year 1 would be \\\\$10,000 / (1 + 0.08)^1 = $9,259.26.\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate the present value of the property's sale price at the end of the 10-year period using the same formula: Present Value = Cash Flow / (1 + Discount Rate)^Number of Years\n",
    "In this case, the present value of the sale price would be \\\\$200,000 / (1 + 0.08)^10 = $98,166.31.\n",
    "\n",
    "Add up the present values of each year's rental income and the present value of the property's sale price to get the total present value of the investment: \\\\$9,259.26 + \\\\$98,166.31 = \\\\$107,425.57.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, according to this DCF analysis, the rental property would be worth \\\\$107,425.57 today if your required rate of return is 8% and your cash flow projections are accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that this is a simplified example, and DCF analysis can be much more complex depending on the nature of the investment and the specific assumptions being made. However, the basic principles of DCF remain the same: estimate future cash flows, discount them to their present value, and use that present value as an estimate of the investment's current worth.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you can calculate discounted cash flow using the numpy library, which provides functions for handling arrays and numerical calculations, and the pandas library, which is used for data manipulation and analysis. Here's an example:"
